# Python-Machine-Learning-Project-2
Project where I critiequ and appraise the scope and limits of machine learning methods by identifying their strengths and weaknesses and using a non-trivial dataset, plan, execute and evaluate significant experimental investigations using multiple machine learning strategies

There are three different project files all written in python using the program spyder(python 3.7) to write my code and show results. Would recommend using this program to run the projects and see the results

A brief to the project itself called "Project 2 Brief" will tell you what the project is about and what has been done to get the results to the problem

A report itself discussing questions from the brief and to illustrate results found in the projects called "Project 2 Report" can be found to explain to you my findings
